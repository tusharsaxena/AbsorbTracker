--
-- The probe itself lives in libs/LibKa0s/Perf.lua and is shared across every Ka0s addon; this file
-- is only the part that is ours: which hot paths get buckets, what "suspended" means here, and where
-- the output goes. The descriptor contract is documented in the LibKa0s repo (its README's
-- descriptor table, and docs/record-schema.md for what a saved run looks like).
--
-- The instance is created at LOAD TIME, before any module takes `local Perf = NS.Perf` as an
-- upvalue — this file sits immediately after core/Util.lua in the TOC for exactly that reason.
